# Introduction: Why Message Brokers?

Welcome! This workshop explores one of the most critical challenges in modern software architecture: reliable communication in distributed systems.

We'll move beyond simple database-driven architectures to understand why and when a dedicated messaging system becomes essential for building scalable and resilient applications. Through practical examples, we will explore the core delivery semantics that every engineer should understand:

*   **At-Most-Once:** When is it okay to just "fire and forget"?
*   **At-Least-Once:** How do we guarantee a message arrives, and what new problems does this create?
*   **Exactly-Once:** What does it take to achieve this "holy grail" of messaging?

By the end of this session, you'll have a clearer understanding of these concepts and be better equipped to design systems that handle failure gracefully and deliver data reliably.
